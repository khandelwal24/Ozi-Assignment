OZI ASSIGNMENT FOR FULL-STACK ROLE:-

Basically This is a task manager where I used (React.js + vite + ShadeCn UI for styling).
The backend was complete but the frontend demands more time,

All the APIS build in this project is checked via Postman and all edge cases have been handled properly for both User and Task I keep seperate folders for both,

The Frontend is Incomplete !!
